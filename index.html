                <p class="float-right">My name is Anthony Hrabbowski. I am currently a student attending a MSU coding bootcamp. I have had many talents in my career. Once refered myself as "One Man Many Talents". 
                I am a Barber, Dj and a Personal Trainer. I once was a Recording Engineer and dabled in the feild of Graphic design for a minute. The Grapic Design is what landed me here. 
                I became facinated with the Worldwide Web and how it looks. So I said to myself I want to design a wbsite. Started with Wix and didn't quite like it that much. Decided to try the 
                UX Design route. Liked it a little, However wanted to get more indepth with it more so than than with all the case studying and interviewing. So I attended Henry Ford Communotty College
                to start my journey as a Web Developer. So here I am Anthony John Hrabowski, Student of the Art of Web Development attending MSU Coding Bootcamp.  </p>
