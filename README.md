## Description

This is a project assignment for our MSU Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp. This project was a from scratch project on a even-numbered week so we weren't given any starter code. Our goal was to create a web application from scratch! We had to build a portfolio page, which consisted of my name, recent photo, links to section about my work and how to contact me. I will continue to build on this project throughout the coarse.
